# EINSTEIN

This is my high-school project - educational platform. In this project, teachers can share their lessons, courses and materials related with courses (videos, documents, presentations) and all files appear for student. In comparison with many other educational platforms, there is no need for student to be registered in the website. This also means that teachers are making their lessons open for anyone with internet connection.

Functionality:
- Teachers can sign up/sign in (encrypted)
- Teachers can create/edit/delete lessons 
- Teachers can make their lessons visible/unvisible
- WYSIWYG in creation of lesson allows to use different types of files, materials as well as designing
